The Intracity Fare Estimation poses a grave threat with a lot of missing values.
By looking carefully we will come to understand that only for few vechiles there is luggage and so on.Therefore the missing values have to be manually resolved.
Imputation can also be used.
Now analysis is very important, if we look carefully in the jupyter notebook or the plots we can see there are 6 cities and farre vary according to the city.
This ias can be exploited well and by using adequate algorithm required efficiency can be obtained.

Here also we have used XGboost. GridsearchCV was used to find the best matching hyperparameters and thus efficiency of nearly 98.1% (R2 score) was achieved.
