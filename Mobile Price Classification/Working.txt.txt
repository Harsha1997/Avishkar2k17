1. For the mobile classification problem , we have to find whether the prices are high or low for a mobile with a particular set of given features.
Missing values - Na
We train the model on the training data and use cross-validation for improving performance.
Use scatter plots and histograms to find out any relationship between any features.
Use of correlation matrix and thereby finding out the most important features.
Finding outliers and eliminating them for better results.
Regularization in order to prevent overfitting.


The most efficient one was Support Vector Machines and yielded efficiency of 96.4%.
Others like KNN,Random Forest and such yielded above 90% but not good enough.
