Housing Prices is a regression problem which requires lots of exploratory data analysis to do.
First we have to merge all the builders,their corresponding works which are haywire and distributed randomnly across the files. 
So we have to get all in one place and then work it up.
Python scripts for:

a) merger, ultimate_merge :- For merging all the data obtained
b)hdT : - The main file where all coding is done


We have had the following obstacles while solving them:
Missing Values- Yes
Ans) Imputation.
     Also some values are replaced by their mean or median based on outliers and so, also some strings were handled as follows:
	Label Encoding - for those which are non numerical
	(Hot encoding (optional))

We also had to find if there were any correlations and we have used the jupyter notebooks for our aid.

We used Random forests with varying depth and estimators got efficiency upto 90%.

But the best was to use XGBoost- by tuning the hyperparameters carefully we can craft a precise understanding of the Housing problem and achieved R2 score of about (97.2%)
